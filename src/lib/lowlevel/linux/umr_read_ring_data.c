/**
 * umr_read_ring_data - Read the entire contents of a ring

 * @ringname:  Common name for the ring, e.g., 'gfx' or 'comp_1.0.0'
 * @ringsize:  Receives the size of the ring in bytes (exluding the 12 byte header)
 *
 * Returns a buffer which contains the ring contents.  The first three
 * words of the buffer are the read, write, and devices write pointer
 * respectively.  The next @ringsize - 12 bytes are the words
 * of the ring.  Note that the ring buffer can wrap around
 * so you need to reduce your indecies modulo (@ringsize / 4).
